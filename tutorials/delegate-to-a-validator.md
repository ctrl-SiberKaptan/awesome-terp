# Delegate Tokens To A Validator

In the view of Chronic Chain's **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)** consensus protocol, the network will consist of numerous validators that require TERP tokens to run nodes, while other TERP token holders can be delegators by staking their tokens to validators and get shared rewards for each newly created block.

Over the course of using **ChronicChain**, TERP token holders can start delegating TERP tokens to any qualified validators on the Chronic Network.

**Reminder:** Prior to the delegation, make sure that you’ve already got an Chronic account in keplr as well as sufficient TERP tokens.

**Step 1:** Visit [**https://stake.terp.network/**](https://stake.terp.network/) and log into your account via **Connect Wallet**.

**Step 2:** Navigate to the **Stake** section, in which you can see a list of validators assigned by ChronicNetwork.


**Step 3:** Enter a certain number of TERP tokens and confirm your delegation.


**Step 4:** A prompt of Keplr will pop up on the screen > Click **Allow** to **Sign Transaction**

Once done, you’ll be redirected to the **Transaction Details**
